# hello-world
Just doing what I'm told, as is the "time honored tradition".
Well I'm switching to a coding caeer after being in one of the most archaic professions in the world for the last ten years, wildland firefighting. That being said we do use helicopters and long-range radios, but the bulk of the work is digging in the dirt with shovels and axes. So my journey into code should be a bit like Marty McFly stepping into the future only to realize if you still have to use your hands to play a game, it's like a babys toy. Cheer to some serious growth!
